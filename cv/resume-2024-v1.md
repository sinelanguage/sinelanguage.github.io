## Education
Originally educated at Sheridan College in 2001, interactive development is an ever evolving trade that requires constant skill refinement, upgrading, and transformation.  Using industry leaders in technology development as my guide, I have investigated every new adoption into our best practice patterns as they are absorbed into our web development culture. For example, as of today, my focus is on performance, browsers as platforms, platforms as services, web services, scalability, portability, rapid deployment, modularity, abstraction, and evangelism.
