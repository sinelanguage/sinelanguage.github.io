    <h3>My approach to all things</h3>
    <p>
      I abstract complexities and practice a pragmatic and holistic approach to life and problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>As a web and app developer, I strive for a lean modular approach. I build high throughput UI at scale. I engineer UI as a function of UX;  enabling users with meaningful capabilities and features by way of a minimal amount of meaningful interactions.  For a real world objective example; Think of the factors involved with the following user experience. Having a key fob in your pocket enables you to lock and unlock your vehicle doors once you are within a predefined radial distance of your vehicle.  That function required zero user enabled events but performed 2 automated functions of a feature.</p>
